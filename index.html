          I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.<br>
          IT WAS ALL A BLUR.<br>
          I ALMOST DIED FROM AN EXPLOSION YESTERDAY.<br>
          IT'S LIKE IT FOLLOWS ME.<br>
          EVERYWHERE I GO, EVERYTHING IS CURSED.<br>
          I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO TO STOP IT.<br>
          IT DOESN'T AFFECT ANYONE ELSE LIKE IT AFFECTS ME.<br>
          I'M GOING TO BUILD A SHRINE AND SEE IF I CAN GET THE CURSE OFF OF ME.<br>
          THIS IS MY FINAL ENTRY IN THIS DIARY.<br>
          THE SITE OF MY SHRINE WILL BE THE MOUNTAIN PEAK AT AROUND -1000 -650, AND IF NOTHING IS THERE THEN CONSIDER ME GONE FOREVER.<br>
